# cheesecake-css-sass

I'm taking a course on Udemy, Advanced CSS and Sass with Jonas Schmedtmann. I've been coding along while watching his videos. He shows us how to make [Natours](http://google.com). I'm making a similar version to practice and better understand CSS and Sass.

I'm not finished with the course so there will be more updates!

# Some features

Customized input fields. Bottom border will turn green when it's filled out correctly and it'll be orange when it's not.

Those are just some features that can be easily shown with a gif. I learned a lot more than just these! There are more styling and css that would be hard showing through a gif so check it out!
